# Summary
Each year the Cato and Fraser Institute release together a report on economic freedom around the world, ranking almost all countries. Countries with a strong economic freedom have higher investment rates, more rapid economic growth, higher income levels, and a more rapid reduction in poverty rates. I am interested in the long term development of economic freedom per continent, distributions of all five factors (mostly are roughly normally distributed or left skewed, but not right skewed) and how each country is performing in 2018 . Also some correlation between the factors were of my interest.
 I anylize the financiar freedom in the World,the monetary freedom by each contry the investiments freedom by gunvernements,Judical Effectiveness in all the countrys in de world,Labor freedom vs unemployment and  trade freedom by each country.
 Australia had a best financial freedom in de world with a 90 index , I can mention here countrys like Canada , Sweden , nederlands , Germany , Austria , France or Spain .The cornerstones of economic freedom are per-sonal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to enter markets and com-pete, and security of the person and privately owned property.

# Analyze Data
I used  index2018-data.xls data and some informations of this site https://www.heritage.org/index/ and https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2016-annual-report
The best financiar freedom in the world is Australia whit an inxed 90.Contrys like Iran , Irak and Afganistan they have maximum 10.
If we talk about monetary freedom we find that contrys like Australie , Spain , Ungary , new Zeeland they are in top and Argentia and Syria have the lowest index.
Monetary freedom combines a measure of price stability with an assessment of price controls. Both inflation and price controls distort market activity. Price stability without microeconomic intervention is the ideal state for the free market.

The score for the monetary freedom component is based on two factors:

The weighted average inflation rate for the most recent three years and
Price controls.
Were in analyze the monetary freedom for the best 10 country in the world .I find that the new Zeeland and Hyngary are the best .We can include here countrys like Nederlands , Italy , Australia, Latvia etc.

Freedom Investments does not offer or provide any investment advice or opinion regarding the nature, potential, value, suitability or profitability of any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction or investment strategy, and any investment decisions you make.
About Investiments freedom we can take as a strong example of countries like Canada , Luxemburg , Hong Kong , Australia , Danamarca etc.

The labor freedom component is a quantitative measure that considers various aspects of the legal and regulatory framework of a country's labor market, including regulations concerning minimum wages, laws inhibiting layoffs, severance requirements, and measurable regulatory restraints on hiring and hours worked.
Here I took as examples the American continent where we find countries like United States, Canada, Colombia, Jamaica and Peru

Trade Freedom
Here we have analyzed the top five countries in the world where trade freedom is at its best.


# Top-rated countries
Hong Kong and Australia and Switezeland, as usual, occupy the top two positions. The next highest scoring nations are New Zealand, Nederlands , Danemark, republik Chek, Finland ,Luxemburg ,Estonia  and Canada, the latter two tied for 10th spot. It is worth noting that the Nederlands returned to the top 10 in 2016 after an absence of several years. Canada also returned to the top 10 after coming in 11th in 2015.

I shere my project in twitter and i colect a feedback from my Udacity teacher .
He told me to change the project and bring the following improvements:
-Awesome work on the visualizations, they are very interesting and the choice is mostly great but here what I think you need to enhance. The map is awesome, try next time try to add another plot and use the map as a filter. Here is a link using your workbook: https://public.tableau.com/profile/wafic#!/vizhome/FinancialFreedomInTheWorld/Dashboard2?publish=yes
In conclusion you have very interesting story, but you need to do some fixes on couple of charts and please try to explore with more variables and more plots and also please make sure to use dashboards as the slides are all single plots. Last please add findings and summary in the caption section of each slide explaining the findings you have discovered in every slide.
