# Summary
Each year the Cato and Fraser Institute release together a report on economic freedom around the world, ranking almost all countries. Countries with a strong economic freedom have higher investment rates, more rapid economic growth, higher income levels, and a more rapid reduction in poverty rates. I am interested in the long term development of economic freedom per continent, distributions of all five factors (mostly are roughly normally distributed or left skewed, but not right skewed) and how each country is performing in 2018 . Also some correlation between the factors were of my interest.
 I anylize the financiar freedom in the World,the monetary freedom by each contry the investiments freedom by gunvernements,Judical Effectiveness in all the countrys in de world,Labor freedom vs unemployment and  trade freedom by each country.

# Analyze Data
I used  index2018-data.xls data and some informations of this site https://www.heritage.org/index/ and https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2016-annual-report
The best financiar freedom in the world is Australia whit an inxed 90.Contrys like Iran , Irak and Afganistan they have maximum 10.
If we talk about monetary freedom we find that contrys like Australie , Spain , Ungary , new Zeeland they are in top and Argentia and Syria have the lowest index.


# Top-rated countries
Hong Kong and Australia and Switezeland, as usual, occupy the top two positions. The next highest scoring nations are New Zealand, Nederlands , Danemark, republik Chek, Finland ,Luxemburg ,Estonia  and Canada, the latter two tied for 10th spot. It is worth noting that the Nederlands returned to the top 10 in 2016 after an absence of several years. Canada also returned to the top 10 after coming in 11th in 2015.

# Lowest-rated countries
The 8 lowest-rated countries are: Venezuela , Iran, Belarus,Zimbabwe , Turkmenistan, Cuba , Afghanistan and Uzbekistan.
